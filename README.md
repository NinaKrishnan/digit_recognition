Deep learning model built as a 2D convolutional neural network to classify handwritten digits on drug prescriptions. Model evaluates to 99.2% accuracy during training and 99.0% accuracy during validation. Trained and validated on MNIST dataset: 60,000 training images, 10,000 testing images.

Interactive dashboard features real-time data visualization, accuracy and cross-entropy analyses, and principal component analysis visualized with matplotlib.
